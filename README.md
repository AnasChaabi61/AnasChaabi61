👋 Hi, I’m @AnasChaabi

👀 I’m interested in revolutionary projects, especially those involving cutting-edge technologies. For example, I recently worked on a project that allows users to upload videos for chat interactions with llm models ,similar to the feature recently added by OpenAI. I actually started working on this project before OpenAI introduced their version, though I completed mine afterward. I have a strong passion for developing innovative solutions like this.

🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in various platforms and tools, including FastAPI, Vue.js 3, and more. I also have experience in Python, JavaScript, C, and enjoy working on automation projects like bots

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of technology and create impactful solutions .
